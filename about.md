  Hey there! Thanks for wanting to know more about me. This page is updated irregularly with more projects and other random stuff.
</p>

I was a derivatives salesperson in the investment banking industry for 2 years and later on co-founded a peer-to-peer lending platform for college students in Taiwan. Having had the fortune of discovering my interests in software development, I set out to obtain a computer science degree in the United States. In order to achieve that, I moved to Australia to get away from my usual social circles and am working hard to save money for the education and am studying the fundamentals of computer science. This website shall record parts of the journey.
