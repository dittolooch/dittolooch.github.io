  Hey there! Thanks for wanting to know more about me. This page is updated irregularly with more projects and other random stuff.
</p>

I was a derivatives salesperson in the investment banking industry for 2 years and later on co-founded a peer-to-peer lending platform for college students in Taiwan.

Having had the fortune of discovering my interests in software development, I set out to become a tech professional working within finance and technology in the United States.
