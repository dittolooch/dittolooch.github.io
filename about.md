  Hey there! Thanks for wanting to know more about me. This page is updated irregularly with more projects and other random stuff.
</p>

I was a derivatives salesperson in the investment banking industry for 2 years and later on co-founded a peer-to-peer lending platform for college students in Taiwan.

I am not a software developer (yet) but I am working on becoming one in the near future.
